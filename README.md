💡 Concept & Inspiration
The portfolio is inspired by the high-octane, fast-paced world of Formula 1. Each section is modeled to reflect the intensity, precision, and style of a Grand Prix event — from the "Technical Specs" (skills) to the "Driver Profile" (bio).
You don’t just scroll — you race through the journey of who I am as a developer.
